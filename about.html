                <p class="history-text">
                    Gene 3's Catering started from humble beginnings with a husband and wife duo, both working hard to make ends meet. They began their journey by selling home-cooked meals, with a special focus on their signature dish: okoy, or fried squash. Their dedication and love for food quickly made their meals a hit, drawing in loyal customers.  <br> <br>The couple's strong work ethic, combined with their passion for food, allowed them to grow their business from scratch. Along the way, they were blessed with three children, all of whom shared their love for creativity and entrepreneurship. The family is also known for their musical talents, with each member contributing to the harmonious atmosphere in their home and even during their events.  <br> <br>Their middle child, inspired by the family’s creative spirit, started a successful balloon designing business. This venture complemented the catering service, providing beautiful, customized decor for events, creating a truly unforgettable experience for their clients.  Today, Gene 3's Catering stands as a testament to hard work, love, and family, continuing to provide delicious meals and exceptional service while maintaining the values that started it all.
